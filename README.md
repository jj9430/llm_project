# Email Generator LLM Project

I made this LLM project using Pytorch after reading Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka. I coded the transformer architecture and finetuned the project based on my custom email dataset. The LLM trains on the dataset and generates responses to json file showing the model compared to the dataset. I added features like an interactive graph and tensorboard showing the training loss and validation loss over epochs. The finetuned model generates accurate and contextually relevant email responses.
