# LLM Email Generator

This project implements a Large Language Model (LLM) using PyTorch, inspired by Sebastian Raschka's "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)". The model is fine-tuned on a custom email dataset to generate contextually relevant email responses.


### Features
-  transformer architecture implementation
- Fine-tuning on a custom email dataset
- Interactive visualization of model performance
- TensorBoard integration for loss tracking
- JSON output of model-generated responses compared to the dataset
